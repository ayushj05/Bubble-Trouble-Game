Features implemented:

1. Incorporated vertical motion of the bubbles making their trajectories parabolic. Also incorporated bouncing of bubbles upon hitting the ground.

2. Introduced collision between the bullet and the bubble. Upon colliding, both of them disappear.

3. Introduced collision between the bubble and the shooter. Shooter's health decreases by 1 (and also colour changes) when a bubble touches it.

4. Introduced bubbles of different sizes. Larger bubbles disintegrate upon getting hit. The smaller bubbles so formed are of half the radius
   of the larger bubble and move in horizontally opposite directions.

5. Added a time, score and health counter. Score increases when a bullet hits a bubble. Game gets over when the shooter either runs out of health
   or if it runs out of time.

6. Introduced multiple levels. Upon completing a level (by destroying all the bubbles), we move onto the next level which is more difficult due
   to more bubbles with some or all of their speeds and sizes increased. Also the colour of the bubbles is different for different levels.
